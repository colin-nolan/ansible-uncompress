# ansible-uncompress
Uncompress module for ansible

Motivated by the push-back against .gz .bz2 not being supported for compressed
files: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/issues/3241#issuecomment-240991265

and the existance of this project: https://github.com/vadikgo/uncompress.

Updating the existing project to support installation via a `meta/requirements.yml`
file and then submitting to ansible galaxy so that it can be found and installed
easily.
